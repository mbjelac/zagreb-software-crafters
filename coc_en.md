# Code of Conduct for the Zagreb Software Crafters Community

Please read our full code of conduct before participating in online discussions or attending community events. But please don’t feel intimidated by it—these are simple rules, and they will make life better for everyone.

## Why we have a CoC

We are dedicated to building a community where everybody can learn, teach, share, network and have a good time. This can only work if we are inclusive to the largest number of contributors, and if we create an environment, where everybody feels safe and welcome.

Yes, we value discussion and disagreement. And discussion can become heated. But there have to be rules, and there has to be a red line.

In this code of conduct, we lay out those rules and red lines.

## Safe Environment

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, programming language, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

And so we invite all those who participate in the Zagreb Software Crafters community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone. With your help, our community gatherings can be a great experience for everyone!

- Treat everyone professionally. Everyone at our events is a professional in their field. Treat all attendees as equals. Ask before you teach. Do not explain things without being asked. The person you are talking to right now might know more, or different things about the topic than you!
- Be welcoming, friendly, and patient. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Ask questions before jumping to conclusions.
- Be respectful. Not all of us will agree with each other all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
- Be aware of the effect your words may have on others. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.
- Whenever possible, use inclusive language: For example, say "folks" or "friends" instead of "guys", and be mindful that some people prefer different pronouns than those you would assume.
- If you misspeak, don't feel bad — just apologize and do better next time.
- Be careful with jokes. We do not tolerate any CoC violations, even if “it was just a joke”.
- Admit when you do not know something. Encourage others to admit when they do not know something — and never joke about it. We are all here to learn.

## CoC Violations

If you think someone has violated our code of conduct—even if you were not directly involved, like you just overheard a conversation—please:

1. Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop.
2. Contact the organisers of Zagreb Software Crafters (See contact details below).

But please give people the benefit of doubt. If there is even a slight chance that this was a misunderstanding (e.g. the person did not speak in their native language, and did not find the right words), try to sort it out in a friendly, constructive way.

When we learn about a CoC violation, organisers will hear both sides, and then take action we deem appropriate, such as:

- Give a warning
- Have a longer talk about our values
- Asking the person to leave the event
- Call the authorities

## Unacceptable Behaviour

Unacceptable behaviour includes, but is not limited to:

- Harassment, and other exclusionary behaviour. Deliberate intimidation and threats.
- Aggressive or sexualized language and content. Unwanted sexual advances.
- Insulting or putting down other participants.
- Publishing or telling others, that a participant belongs to a particular identity channel without asking their consent first.
- “Well-actuallies”: Telling people what they “actually meant to say”.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Need Help

If you need help, have questions, or concerns, please reach out to the organisers of Zagreb Software Crafters:

- Find and speak with an organiser directly
- Contact: [marko.bjelac@gmail.com](mailto:marko.bjelac@gmail.com)

This code of conduct applies to the Zagreb Software Crafters community and all its events, as well as all related digital spaces, such as the [Meetup.com group](https://www.meetup.com/zagreb-software-crafters/).
